#@classmethod
# Like static methods class methods are not bound to instances, 
# but unlike static methods class methods are bound to a class. 
# The first parameter of a class method is a reference to a class, i.e. a class object. 
# They can be called via an instance or the class name

#@staticmethod
#don't have any access to what the class is- it's basically just a function, 
# called syntactically like a method, 
# but without access to the object and it's internals (fields and another methods), while classmethod does
#they are helpful in method overriding

#Abstract methods: @baseclass.abstractmethod eg: @Car.abstractmethod
#Is a method defined in Base class, without any implementation.
#Class inheriting Base class should override the abstract method to process.
