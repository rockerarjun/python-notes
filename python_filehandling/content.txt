If any argument is a float and there are fractional microseconds, 
the fractional microseconds left over from all arguments are combined and their sum is rounded
to the nearest microsecond using round-half-to-even tiebreaker. 
If no argument is a float, 
the conversion and normalization processes are exact (no information is lost).
